# Frontend (React)

The planned frontend is a React app (see `specification.md`).

## Note
This environment currently does not have a Node.js package manager (`npm`) available, so scaffolding via Vite/Create-React-App is blocked.

When Node.js is available, we can scaffold with Vite:
- `npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react-ts`

Until then, backend development can proceed independently.
